      <p>
        My name is Matthew Jackson, I was born in Plano, Texas and have lived in North Texas my whole life. I'm currently going through the web development bootcamp at SMU, I've learned how to build webpages using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I don't have much experience with coding to put in here so this is about to turn into me just talking about what I like to do.

        Growing up I always loved music and as I got older I started learning how to make my own, I've been playing guitar for about 7 years now and love learning new instruments whenever I can. A little over a year ago one of my friends invited me to go out dancing to meet some of his friends and see what it's about and now I'm a competitive country dancer and spend most of my nights out dancing.
